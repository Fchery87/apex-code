# Phase 2b OS sandbox

**Status:** Active

Implement the OS sandbox as a whole-Apex-process boundary, not a bash wrapper. This
plan implements ADR 0005 and `docs/specs/2026-08-12-os-sandbox.md` in dependency
order; each task must be verified before it is marked done.

| Task | State | Commit | Verification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2b.1 Add Apex sandbox domain types, configuration validation, bounded violations, and fail-closed preflight tests | Done | `269302eb0` | `test/sandbox/` passed after red module-import failures |
| 2b.2 Implement Linux supervisor/backend and process-child launch sentinel | Done | `79ce14d60` | Fake-backend routing/lifecycle tests pass; public entry launches a separate child entry |
| 2b.3 Add Linux OS integration fixtures for workspace write, outside-write refusal, blocked network, and grandchild containment | Done | `79ce14d60` | Real Bubblewrap child/grandchild write, host-home, and direct TCP-denial tests pass |
| 2b.4 Wire CLI diagnostics/lifecycle and package distributable dependency | Done | `79ce14d60` | CLI routing/fail-closed process tests, typecheck, and package build pass |
| 2b.5 Add macOS backend only after native CI proof; document unsupported Windows | Not started | — | macOS integration tests pass |
| 2b.6 Full verification and documentation closure | Not started | — | Focused suites, typecheck, build, full test; plan deleted |

## Order changes

The inherited optional sandbox extension is not promoted as the implementation path:
it wraps only bash and would leave native tools, extensions, and in-process execution
outside the claimed boundary. The initial concrete backend is Linux because its
Bubblewrap behavior is testable in the current development environment; macOS follows
only with native evidence.
